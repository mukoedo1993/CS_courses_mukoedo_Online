Bold = <strong>Example text</strong>


Italic = <em>Example text</em>


An strong element is an element we can use
to give strong importance for a bit of text.

<b> works in the same way as <strong>.
While most of browsers will render <b> in strong font,
But in css, b only stands for bold not for importance.
<dfn> is better than <em>, though both render the italic font.
<i class = "term"> </i>is better than naked <i></i>.
Because some non-English language may treat it in a different way.


But, do not use strong tag to make your entire paragraph bold unless you
actually to designated that all the paragraph important. -->SWITCH TO CSS at this time.

CSS -> design decisions
HTML -> content description decisions
