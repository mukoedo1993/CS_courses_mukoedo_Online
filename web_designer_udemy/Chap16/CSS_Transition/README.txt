To let human eyes to see all of the intermediate states of color gradations?
CSS transition:
color transition with an interval of time:
    transition-property: color, background-color;
    transition-duration: 2s;

Push down a part:
transform: translateY(0);

    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 3s;
    transform: translateY(100%);

 transition-timing-function: linear; /*ease-in ease-out*/

Conclusions:
We use the hover pseudo-selector to create a situation where element in different situation will receive different
values. Transition could be used in hover and many many other effects.
