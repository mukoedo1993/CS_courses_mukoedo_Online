Animation begins play on page below...

Make four key features boxes don't fade at the exactly same time (millesecond...),
instead, stacked, one after the next.

Star animation has unique animation when you load...


e.g.1:
@keyframes fadeBounce

.box-a {
    animation-name: fadeBounce;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    ...
}


e.g.2:
animation-delay: make four key features appear one after one, rather than appear simultaneously.
