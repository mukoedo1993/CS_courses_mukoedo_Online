If we use a small screen, then the nevigations will be hidden,
and a new button MENU will appear.

And, we want to make browser to only show important text and a link
to full text. Once we showed the full text, the link will turn to a
collapse button.


Our solutions:
1:custom HTML & CSS
2: JavaScript: Declarative Toggle
In this scenario, Javascript will handle the click or tap events and it
will also add and remove the right classes at the right moment to the right elements.



In HTML:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/cycle2.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="js/declarativeToggle.js"></script>
