            We had the faith in hearts for your salvation. Oh, our Homeland, we cleansed your face and eyes with blood,
            With the rising flame, our name has been cleansed
            Our efforts became a friend / lover to you
            Broad and Famous with Effort were our Ancestors

            Our forefathersâ€™ battles will not be erased from the pages of history
            Their offspring are left warriors, we are their descendants.
            We gave our lives, spilled our blood and had our revenge from the enemy
            Long live, for eternity, may our future shine.
