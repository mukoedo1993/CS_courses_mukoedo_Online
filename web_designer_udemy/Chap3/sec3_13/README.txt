video element:
Some browsers might not be able to process mp4 file correctly.
So, I add webm file.

It will stop seeking once one of video file is found.


Extra notes:
It's Complicated...
-Older browser support
-Video resolution (match vistiors' internet connection speed)
1: automatically detect the video's speed and adjust the resolution of the video
2: resolution picker 
- Custom UI / Branding Concerns
(JS code needed here)
Outside the scope of HTML...
Video Hosting Service is recommended here...
