Extra notes:
If you're trying to display, please use SVG as much as possible.
Because, nowadays, our computer tend to have higher and higher pixel density ratios,
meaning the physical sizes of our screens aren't getting leagrer, but the No. of pixels 
crammed into that same sized screen is increasing. So, you could scale sth almost infinitely,
and super sharp and crisp on modern PC screen.
figma: for SVG
You could read SVG as a code file.

Glossary:
raster graphic:
In computer graphics and digital photography, a raster graphic is a dot matrix data structure that represents 
a generally rectangular grid of pixels (points of color), viewable via a computer display, paper, or other display medium. 
Raster images are stored in image files with varying dissemination, production, generation, and acquisition formats.


Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 
is an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support 
for interactivity and animation.
 The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999.
