Course 50:

The use of CSS float property does have a More
modern alternative nowadays, and it's something called
flex box.


e.g:
.row {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: rwap;
}
The div with the class of row now says display flex
and then the actual columns, they are no longer floated to the left.
