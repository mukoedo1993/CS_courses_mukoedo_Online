Think of sections as chapters.
Not necessarily chapters in a literal sense/
Think: Parts of a whole.

Every header element is set as h1, but they look like, hierarchially, h1, h2, h3, et cetera...

h1,2,3 and section are both ok as soon as your conent is accessible, has semantic meaning and 
makes sense from a document outline.

Technology changes.
Excellent conetnt is timeless.
