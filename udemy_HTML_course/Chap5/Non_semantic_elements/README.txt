Two zero-semantic meaning elements:
block level
<div></div> = division / section
a non sematic version of header footer and article.

<span></span> inline level
We simply want to stylize the word without emphasizing or implying 
this word. But helpful with attribute of class or href...

Neither of them has any semantic meaning...
