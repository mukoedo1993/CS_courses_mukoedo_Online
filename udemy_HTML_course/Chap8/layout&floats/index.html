            Oh, our Homeland, we cleansed your face and eyes with blood,
            With the rising flame, our name has been cleansed
            Our efforts became a friend / lover to you
            Broad and Famous with Effort were our Ancestors

                Our blood flowed like water on the path of salvation
For your oh our Homeland, may our lives be a sacrifice.
By giving our blood and lives we finally saved you,
We had the faith in hearts for your salvation.

Our forefathersâ€™ battles will not be erased from the pages of history
Their offspring are left warriors, we are their descendants.
We gave our lives, spilled our blood and had our revenge from the enemy
Long live, for eternity, may our future shine.
