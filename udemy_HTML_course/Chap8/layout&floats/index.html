            Oh, our Homeland, we cleansed your face and eyes with blood,
            With the rising flame, our name has been cleansed
            Our efforts became a friend / lover to you
            Broad and Famous with Effort were our Ancestors
       

        <div class="main-area">
            <p>This is the main area (or column). 
                Our blood flowed like water on the path of salvation
For your oh our Homeland, may our lives be a sacrifice.
By giving our blood and lives we finally saved you,
We had the faith in hearts for your salvation.

            <p>

Our forefathersâ€™ battles will not be erased from the pages of history
Their offspring are left warriors, we are their descendants.
We gave our lives, spilled our blood and had our revenge from the enemy
Long live, for eternity, may our future shine.

                    After the columns for two elements, main-area and side-bar, but still within content-area parent div.
                    However, the content-area parent element doesn't know either of them.
                    It calls its parent element, content-area to look at it so that fix class exists. Fix class is clearing
                    the floats. And because this element sits below the float element, the parent element then aware of all these features.

                    But it's not best practice. Because it's a blank element.
                    So, we add a new attribute on the content-base parent element directly.
