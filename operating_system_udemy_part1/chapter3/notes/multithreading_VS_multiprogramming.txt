multiprocessing VS multiprogramming
(I):
Multiprocessing refers to processing of multiple processes at same time
by multiple CPUs.
Multiprogramming keeps several programs in main memory at the same time and
execute them concurrenctly utilizing single CPU.

(II):
Multiprocessing utilizes multiple CPUs.
Multiprogramming utilizes single CPU.

(III):
Multiprocessing permits parallel processing.

But for multiprogramming, context switching takes place.
(Glossary: In computing, a context switch is the process of storing the state of a process
or thread, so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later point.


(IV):
For Multiprocessing, less time taken to process the jobs.
For, multiprogramming takes more time to process the jobs.

(V):
For Multiprocessing: it facilitates much efficient utilization of devices
of the computer system.
For multiprogramming, it is less efficient than multiprocessing.

(VI):
For multiprocessing, it is usu. more expensive.
For multiprogramming, such systems are less expensive.
