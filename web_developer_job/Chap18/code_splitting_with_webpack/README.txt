e.g.
Picture our modal of javascript is 200 or 300 lines of code.
So imagine you have this sizable bit of code that the user doesn't need...

We want to prevent the user from loading Javascript file until you click the button, Get in Touch.

App.js:
line 30:
to generate a bundled js file named modal.bundled.js

...
If you have a large and complex javascript module that you don't need to load right away, then, you have 
an option to load it on the fly.
...
You want to save a variable if you're goint to need to access it or call its methods later on.
...
```
 npm install event-emitter
 ```
 What does event-emitter do?
 If a certain event happens, you can emit your event back into your main JS file.
 And, when your main JS file detects that event, it could call the method on another object.
 This way your individual modules don't need to import or even be aware of the other modules. 
 With each module self-contained, but main JavaScript file is sort of the puppeteer. You can broadcast certain
 events to it. And, then if you've been storing your objects in variables, as we saw here, it's very easy to begin
 working with that and then call a certain method.
