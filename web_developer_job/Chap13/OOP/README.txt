Q1: What is Object-Oriented programming(OOP)?

Stop thinking in terms of individual variables and functions.

Begin thinking in terms of cohesive, self-sufficient objects.

Object: an entity that has data and behavior.
resemblance: noun and verb





Method:
A function contained by an object is no longer a function, but a method.
