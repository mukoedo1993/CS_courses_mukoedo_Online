Our target: 
styling testimonials
Using testimonial-ver2 branch

PART 1:

PART 2:
issues: tesimonials and real testimonials title overlapped:
Because we used position relative to pull these images up out
of their natural position.

Modify the gapping between each testimonial...
And adjust three testimonials so that each one has equal height...
using flex box...
PART 3:
In the medium screen, there will not be enough space for three-column layout.
So, we set the large screen as a watershed line for testimonials' responsive design.
Finally, merge the testimonial-ver2 branch into the main branch. Mission completed.
