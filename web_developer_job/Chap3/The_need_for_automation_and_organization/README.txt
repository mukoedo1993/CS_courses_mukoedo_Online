Question:
Are all of these tools necessary, like git?

Answer:
While we build our site we want automation and organization.
Automation <--Save our time
Organization <-- Save our sanity

e.g.1:
If you perform this tiny task twice a minute during your
day that's 48 minutes you can save with automation.

Automation Example #1
Automatic browser refreshing.

#2:
Autoprefixer:
autoprefixer: Set up our computer to watch for any saved changes to a file and then it will automatically trigger a filter to run our css files. And the computer is intelligent enough to know which properties need to prefixed and it will automatically add those prefixes to access. (Because, sometimes, different browsers might require different properties' names in CSS).
#3:
combine multiple separate css files into one single big
CSS file.


Package management:
to manage files better and faster.
