1: What is Git?
Super popular version control system. 
Git helps us manage project's files.

Git is a tool we install on our computer. It keeps track of
every change we make to our project.

It tells us exactly on which day we changed which files, and it will
even show us which lines of code we changed which files. And it will even 
show which line we added and which lines of code we removed.

Collaboration:
teamwork<- a common conern:
trying to avoid accidentally deleting or overriding each other's progress.

e.g.
Somebody sends email:
1: Hey budddy, here's the first chapter and a half, do you mind making a few
edits and finishing the 2nd chapter? And then sending the attachment back to me?

(You're stuck, waiting for friend's updates.)
(If there is a conflict... )
Without someone needs to comb through both copies, find all changes and merge the two:

No waiting;
continue working.

Git merges for us.
Git saves the day.


Feature branches:
Task No.1, we need to redesign the header of the website, maybe add a new logo, change the slogan, change
the colors.
Task No. 2, we need to adjust the styling and ordering of the links in the footer.

Git helps us to merge two features.

git : industrial standard.

Git in action <- next step...



Git In Action:
1: Grow our Git vocabulary.
Project = Repository(repo)
A repository is where it saves all of the data, all of the history,
all of the changes that it tracks.

Working directory

Staging (Preparing, getting ready): <-- Control what gets commited
(git add. is a synonym of it. I prefer git add.)
Before we are allowed to commit changes, we first have to stage our changes.
Resemblance:
Real Estate:
Sometimes before you can sell a home, you first have to stage the home.

Commit
You can think of a commit as a secondary save...
Commit = Git's way of "saving"
