3: JS to hide overlay initially and reveal on click.

------------------------------------------------------
course 56:
1: Write Javascript to make the website alive
...
The modal is hidden when you first open the website,
the only time you could see it is when you use javascript to make it appear.
So, if Javascript is disabled in user's device, it is useless to send them this information at all.
...
We don't want the modal to be visible when you first come to the page.<--
Write CSS so that modal is hidden by default.
...
Listen to key-up and key-down events so that you could close the modal not only by clicking the 
X button but also press the escape key.
...
every key on the keyboard has a numerical value associated with it.
escape key: 27
...
But, what if client never click on the modal? Do we still need to force the user to download js code?
